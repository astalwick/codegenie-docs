Getting started with CodeGenie is simple. Once you have [Installed CodeGenie](/docs/install-codegenie), you can immediately start working with it.

There are two ways to interact with CodeGenie: By using the VSCode [Command Palette](#command-palette), or by using the [Context Menu](#context-menu) directly in your source code windows.

## Command Palette
The Command Palette integration gives you incredibly quick integration without requiring the mouse. You can see all of the commands available to you by hitting Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-P and typing 'CodeGenie'.

For example, to refactor some code, you simply need to:

  1. Highlight your code
  2. Hit Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-P
  3. Type 'codegenie' and select 'CodeGenie: Refactor Code'

## Context Menu
For those of us who love the mouse, CodeGenie integrates directly into the Context Menu of your source code editor. Simply right-click on a highlighted snippet of code, and select your CodeGenie command.

The same refactor example looks like this:
1. Highlight your code
2. Right-click and select 'CodeGenie: Refactor Code'
