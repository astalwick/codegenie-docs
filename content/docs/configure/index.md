## Configurable prompts and models

You're in control here. CodeGenie allows you to fully customize all of the preset prompts, including the alignment prompt sent at the beginning of every chat. Would you like CodeGenie to take on a more specific persona or to be more direct in its feedback?  Modify the Alignment prompt.  Is the refactor command not doing exactly what you'd like it to? Change the 'CodeGenie: Refactor' prompt!

Also configurable in CodeGenie is the specific LLM model used. You can choose from either gpt-3.5-turbo (default) or gpt-4. Note that not everyone has access to GPT-4 right now, so if selecting GPT-4 fails, verify your access with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
