CodeGenie fully supports resumeable chat histories and chat history browsing, saved locally to your machine.

Chats are organized according to active workspace, to make it easier to refer back to relevant chats from the past.

By default, CodeGenie automatically resumes the most recent conversation when you trigger a command. However, it is very easy to start a new chat - just click the 'Start a New Chat' button before you ask your question.

This is a newer area of the CodeGenie feature set, so additional changes will be added soon.

### New Chat

To start a new chat, you can click the '...' button at the top right of the CodeGenie window and then click the 'New Chat' button.

### Load Previous Chat

To load a past conversation, click the '...' button at the top right of the CodeGenie panel, then use the dropdown to select the chat you'd like to load.
