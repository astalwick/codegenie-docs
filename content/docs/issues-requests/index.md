CodeGenie is pretty new! So please do expect some issure here and there.

If you do have any problems to report, or any feature requests you'd like to make, I'd really love to hear them. You have three great options:
1. Submit an issue on the [CodeGenie Github Repo](https://github.com/astalwick/codegenie-docs/issues)
2. Tweet at me (https://twitter.com/@astalwick) or message me on Mastodon (@astalwick@mastodon.social)
3. Email me directly: arlen@nsono.net
